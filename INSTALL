Hopefully as simple as

   # ./configure
   # make
   # make install

If you don't already have a config file, do

   # mv /etc/pdq/printrc.example  /etc/pdq/printrc



Note that configure takes two arguments for adjusting resource location:

  --enable-pdqlibdir=DIR  place to install drivers and interfaces;
                          does not affect behavior of executables

  --enable-printrc=FILE   optional substitution for /etc/pdq/printrc
